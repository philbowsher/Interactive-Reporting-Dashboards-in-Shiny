## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(d3scatter)
library(crosstalk)

shared_mtcars <- SharedData$new(mtcars)
bscols(widths = c(3,NA,NA),
  list(
    filter_checkbox("cyl", "Cylinders", shared_mtcars, ~cyl, inline = TRUE),
    filter_slider("hp", "Horsepower", shared_mtcars, ~hp, width = "100%"),
    filter_select("auto", "Automatic", shared_mtcars, ~ifelse(am == 0, "Yes", "No"))
  ),
  d3scatter(shared_mtcars, ~wt, ~mpg, ~factor(cyl), width="100%", height=250),
  d3scatter(shared_mtcars, ~hp, ~qsec, ~factor(cyl), width="100%", height=250)
)
```
